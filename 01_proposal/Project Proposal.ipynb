    "In this project, I want to study data from the National Football League - and learn how much home field advantage matter to the outcome in football. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this project, my prior belief is that what is called \"home field advantage\" is actually a combination of how much a team has to travel, how much rest they have inbetween games, and crowd energy. The 2020 NFL season so far has presented an interesting natural experiment in this sense: teams still have to travel, but many stadiums are not packed. How does this affect a team's performance? \n",

    "My plan is build my own dataset from webscraping football analytics websites, then build a simple model on data for seasons prior to 2020, and see how the model does with games in the 2020 season."

    "\n",
    "a) $Point \\, spread$ and $Home \\, field$ can be scraped from [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/games.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/games.htm)  (example for 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) $Fans \\, attendance$ can be scraped from [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/attendance.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/attendance.htm).   \n",
    "\n",
    "(Pro-football-reference only has attendance data from 1992 onwards, so 1992 will be the first year in my dataset.)\n",

    "c) $Time \\, since \\, last \\, game$ can be calculated for each team with the table obtained from part a.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) $Distance \\, traveled$ will be trickier to put together. This is because 1) Some teams will have moved cities & stadiums since the dataset starts in 1992, so I can't use a static dataset of distance between each current city/ stadium; 2) I will need to account for games played in London & Mexico City.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* The data for a stadium's city will be scraped from [this Wikipedia table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_home_stadiums_for_current_National_Football_League_teams). \n",
    "\n",
    "* I will use links for each stadium in the table to scrape the stadium's coordinates, then use the [Haversine formula](https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-find-the-distance-between-two-lat-long-coordinates-in-python) to calculate the distance between 2 stadiums (instead of airports).\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Opponent quality will likely be a set of variables - for example, the overall ranking of the opponent's defense [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1992/opp.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1992/opp.htm).\n"

I will likely write 2 scrapers for each variable - one for data from seasons 1992 - 2019, which will only need to be run once, and one for the 2020 season data, which I can re-run as least once a week for new updates.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* Data visualization: Since each game is played by 2 teams, I expect the final dataset will be a dyadic dataset. I will need to think more about how I can visualize sports/ dyadic data.  \n",
